    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The database I have chosen for the analysis is the one called \"European Soccer Database\", which is a collection of matches', teams' and players' data for European association football (or soccer in American English). As it can be seen in the website mentioned in ref. <a href=\"#ref1\">[1]</a>, the database contains data from more than 25000 matches, spread over nine seasons, including detailed information on different match events, such as goal types and ball possession. In addition, it includes the squad formation for a large number of matches, as well as other interesting information such as betting odds and players' attributes extracted from EA Sports FIFA video game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size and extent of this database offer countless possibilities for investigation, particularly for a person with such a passion for football as myself. For this reason, I have used the information available on the Kaggle website to review the content and variables of the database in order to get myself familiar with it and decide which points I would like to investigate. After this preliminary check, I reached the conclusion that in my analysis I would like to try to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Do teams playing at home win more matches? Do they also score more goals than the away teams?</li>\n",
    "<li>What is the impact of the ball possession on the final result? Does more possession lead to more victories? Does more possession also lead to more goals for and less goals against?</li>\n",
    "<li>How does the squad formation influence the results? Do some formations have a significantly larger percentage of victories than others? Do formations with more forwards lead to more goals scored? And do formations with more defenders result in less goals conceded?</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for choosing to focus on these topics is that, when reading about football in the press or when discussing it with friends, these points are frequently mentioned as being the key factors explaining the performance of a given team. In particular, the ball possession has been brought to the spotlight in the past decades with the irruption of a new wave in football &mdash; embodied by managers such as Pep Guardiola and Arsène Wenger &mdash; which emphasizes the importance of controlling the ball possession as the best means to achieve victory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this investigation is thus not so much to answer why playing home or controlling the ball possession represents an advantage, but to find out whether these statements are really backed by evidence or not."

In addition, this method allows you to tailor the variables that you want to import. The only drawback is that you have to be very careful not to forget or mistype any variable.\n",

Given that the database contains data from more than 25000 matches, spread over 8 seasons and for 11 different countries &mdash; i.e. the data represents a considerably large sample of the population, it seems reasonable to assume that teams have a bigger chance of winning a match when playing home. This can be due to many factors, such as having the support of their own fans, cheering for them during the match, or because they are more used to playing on that particular field; this point, however, is beyond the scope of this analysis.\n",

Since the percentages given above are computed for the complete database, it might as well be that there are large variations between the different countries which, when averaged, give the results shown above. For this, I will compute the percentages of home and away wins, as well as draws, for all the countries."

    "As it can be seen, all the countries present a similar level of home victories, with a variation within $\\pm$ 5% of the global average, which provides more confidence to the assumption made above that teams playing home have a larger chance of winning the match. However, it could be the case that in countries with a lower percentage of home victories &mdash; e.g. Scotland &mdash; the percentage of away victories reaches the same or even a higher level than the home victories, which would contradict the assumption made. For this, I will plot the percentages of home victories, away victories and draws for three different countries: Scotland, with the lowest home wins percentage; Spain, with the largest one; and England, which lies more or less around the average."

    "Even though the percentage of away victories in Scotland is slightly larger than in the other two countries, there is still a significant different between the levels of home and away victories. This confirms that even in the country with the lowest rate of home victories, the teams playing home win more matches than the away teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting point that can be observed in previous two graphs is that, even though all the countries show a similar pattern, there are some countries which present slightly larger percentages of home victories than others. This could mean that the so-called home advantage is stronger in some countries than in others. In particular, Spanish teams playing home win about 49% of the matches, whereas in Scotland, the percentage of home victories does not even reach 42%. The explanation of this fact is outside the scope of this study, however, if I were to try to find an explanation for this, I would probably want to look at data such as the percentage of attendance of away fans in the stadiums (less fans of the away team in the stadium might make it easier for the home team to win) or the dimensions and other conditions of the playing fields (less homogeneous fields might lead to a larger home advantage).\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking at the percentage of home and away victories, the next point that I want to deal with is whether the teams playing home score more goals than the away teams. For this, I will follow a similar approach as before, looking first at the global averages and then segregating the results per country."

    "As it can be observed, there is a strong correlation between both variables. This means that the countries where the home teams win more matches, are also those where the victories of the home teams are obtained by a larger difference in goals, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, the results shown here indicate that the teams playing home win generally more matches than the visiting teams and that they also score more goals per match. This trend seems to be present in all countries available in the database. We have also observed that, when analyzing the data segregated by country, there is a correlation between the percentage of matches won by the home teams and the average goal difference between the home and away teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that I have not looked into, however, are the results separated by teams. This might show somewhat different trends. For example, it might show that some teams have a very large percentage of home victories with respect to the rest of the teams in their league, altering the average of the rate of home victories for that country. It could be the case for Spain, for example, where a couple of very strong teams such as FC Barcelona or Real Madrid CF &mdash; who win most of their matches &mdash; could be increasing the overall percentage of home victories for the country. Nevertheless, for the sake of concision, I will not look further into this and will tackle the next question.\n",

    "### 3.b Question 2: What is the effect of the ball possession percentage?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question that I want to address is the influence of the ball possession percentage in the matches' results. As mentioned before, over the past decade the ball possession has become a recurring topic in football discussions &mdash; both in the press and in the private sphere &mdash; for this reason, I want to make use of the available data to find out whether controlling the ball possession is really essential to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy that I will follow is similar to the one used before: I will first look at the global averages of ball possession and afterwards I will group the data by country, to see if the results are consistent with the global averages or if there are any biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to compute the average of ball possession for all the teams together, separating only between the different types of results: victory, draw and defeat."

    "As we can see, the trend is consistent between countries: winning teams tend to have more possession than losing teams. Nevertheless, the difference in possession percentage between winning and losing teams is relatively small &mdash; less than 5% in average &mdash; which makes it difficult to confirm whether controlling the ball possession is really a key factor to winning or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it can be seen that, despite the small differences between winners and losers, the averages of ball possession are different in all four countries. In particular, the difference in possession between winning and losing teams for Germany is below 2%, whereas in Spain it goes up to almost 6%. This could mean that controlling the ball possession has a larger impact in the chance of winning in Spain than in Germany, which could, in turn, be related to the different kind of football played in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point which I found strange at the beginning is that the average possession for the draws was always equal to 50%. This is nonetheless correct, since the way I have grouped the results by (Win, Draw, Loss) means that for either wins or defeats there is only one team per match accounted for. In the case of draws, however, both teams are taken into account and, therefore, the average possession percentage is exactly 50%. This means, of course, that the abovementioned possession averages are only representative for victories and defeats, and not for draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I want to see if the ball possession has an influence on the number of goals scored and in the number of goals conceded. For this, I will simply plot the possession percentages grouped by number of goals scored using a box plot. The reason for using a box plot is that it not only allows for an identification of the median values of the variable to be analyzed, but also for the dispersion of the same, which can also provide an idea of the size of the sample."

It is interesting to note that both mean and median seem to be quite similar for most of the segments, except on those corresponding to a high number of goals scored, which indicates that most of the data are quite symmetrically distributed around the median.\n",

    "The plot clearly shows that the teams scoring a higher number of goals tend to have more control of the ball. However, one aspect to take into account is that the size of the samples for the segments above 6 goals scored seem to be relatively small compared to the rest &mdash; deduced from the smaller dispersion and larger skewness of the distributions &mdash; indicating that we should not trust too much the trend in this area, and only focus on the previous segments. To check this, I will get the exact number of occurrences for each segment of goals scored."

This result is coherent, as scoring such a large number of goals in one match is extremely difficult and thus, very rare. In any case, even when analyzing only the results up to 6 goals scored, the trend is clear: the higher the amount of goals scored by a team, the larger the ball possession (in average).\n",

I made the assumption then that the last value given for each match corresponded to the average possession for the match. Since I found no information concerning this point, it might as well be that this assumption was not correct, in which case, the results of my analysis would be wrong as well.\n",

I will start by looking at the percentage of victories for all the formation types identified in the database to see how they compare to each other, and then I will study the influence of each individual formation line &mdash; defense, midfield and attack &mdash; on its most relevant variable, i.e. goals conceded, ball possession and goals scored, respectively.\n",

    "As before, the most common formations are quite balanced in the ratios of victories and defeats &mdash; with both ranging between 35 and 40% &mdash; which would make it extremely difficult if we had to choose a formation for our team based only on the historical data contained here. Nevertheless, the 4-3-3 seems to have the highest percentage of victories and the lowest of defeats.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting point is that both formations with 5 defenders (the 5-4-1 and the 5-3-2) present a considerably high ratio of defeats &mdash; around 50% or, in other words, they lose almost every other match. This is somewhat surprising, since these formations are usually considered as defensive in football, meaning that they are usually associated to matches where the team is not so much seeking to win but rather not to lose. This could be caused by the fact that this type of formation is normally used by smaller teams when facing teams which are better than them, in order to try not to concede too many goals, but, in the end, the bigger team usually takes the win.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step in my analysis will be looking at the influence of the amount of players for each formation line in the parameter of the match most related to that specific line. As an example, I want to see if there is a correlation between the number of midfielders in the line-up and the percentage of ball possession achieved by the team. For this, I will first print how many cases there are available for each possible number of midfielders in the formation. It is worth noticing that for this first point (number of midfielders vs. possession), I will use the subset of the database which contains possession data."

    "One would be expect that the more players in the midfield a team lined up in a given match, the more ball possession they would attain at the end of that match, as midfielders are usually the ones in charge of keeping possession of the ball and distributing it along the field. However, from the result above we cannot see a clear trend indicating this. It seems that the ball possession remains more or less constant, regardless of the number of midfielders. The exception comes for the formations with 6 midfielders but, due to the low number of cases available, I would tend not to trust this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result seems to indicate that, in terms of ball possession, it is not so relevant the number of midfielders you line up, but rather how they play &mdash; are they more defensive? More offensive? More technical? &mdash; and the instructions or the strategy given by the manager &mdash; is the team really looking to control the ball, or rather just wait to steal the ball from the opponent and launch a quick counter-attack?. I think this is a good example to show that football, as many other fields, cannot be reduced to just numbers, but there are many other factors which come into play.\n",

    "Contrary to what could be expected, the results show that teams playing with 5 defenders receive, in average, more goals than those playing with 4 or 3. However, as noted above, the values for 5 defenders should be treated with care, since the number of cases available is considerably lower than for the other two defense types.\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, the results presented in this section seem to indicate that the formation alone cannot be used as a predictor of the performance of a team: first, there seems to be no single formation which achieves a significantly higher percentage of victories than the rest; also, teams playing with more midfielders do not generally achieve higher levels of ball possession than those with less players in that area; and finally, more populated defensive lines do not lead the team to receive less goals. On the contrary, teams playing with more strikers have a higher average of goals scored. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, these results seem to indicate that there are additional factor influencing the performance of the teams other than the formation type chosen by the manager. Some examples of those factors that are not accounted for could be: the strategy used by the team (e.g. controlling the ball possession vs. pressing and counterattacking); the raw talent of the players of each team (a team playing with 3 very good midfielders will probably have more possession than a team with 5 average midfielders); or even the overall physical condition of the squad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, I would like to bring the attention to two points which could be influencing the results of this analysis. The first one is that, when generating the variables containing the formation of each team, I assigned the players to each formation line based on the y-position given in the database. Since this is a convention selected by me, it could be that it does not apply to all of the teams. For example, one player could have a y-position value of 5 and, therefore, be considered as a midfielder in my analysis, but in reality he might have played as a defender. Therefore, it is not possible to be certain that the distribution of the formations is 100% accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the y-positions given in the database correspond most likely to the formation of the team at the beginning of the match. However, in football it is allowed (and very common) to substitute players during the match, up to three per team. This means that any given team might have changed the formation during the match &mdash; thus probably affecting the final result &mdash; but this is not taken into account in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='conclusions'></a>\n",
    "## 4. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, I would like to summarize the findings of my analysis. First, I analyzed the possible existence of a home advantage, for which I looked at the percentage of victories by the home teams versus the away teams, as well as the goals scored and received by these. The results showed that the teams playing home win, in average, more matches than the away teams. This trend is present in all the countries available in the database, although with a difference of about 7% between the country with the largest share of home victories and the one with the lowest one. Then, we confirmed that the home teams tend to score more goals than the away teams (i.e. a higher average of goals scored). Finally, we discovered that the countries where the home teams have a larger share of victories, are also those where the victories of the home teams are obtained by a larger difference in goals, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterward, I studied the differences in ball possession percentage between winning and losing teams, as well as distribution of ball possession based on the number of goals scored by the teams. This part of the analysis showed that, although only by a small amount, the teams winning the matches tend to have more possession of the ball than the teams losing. This is the case for all the four countries analyzed, even if there were small differences between them. Additionally, we saw that the teams which score a higher number of goals in a match tend to have the control of the ball for longer periods of the match and that the opposite is true when analyzing the number of goals received. These results seem to indicate that ball possession might have an impact on the outcome of the match, however, since I have not done any statistical testing, I cannot draw any conclusions on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I analyzed the performance of the teams based on the formation they used; first, by looking at the overall percentage of victories and defeats of each formation, and then by investigating the correlation between the number of players in each formation line and the most relevant variable for that line. The results showed that there is no single formation which achieves a significantly higher percentage of victories than the rest. However, it was interesting to see that the formations using 5 defenders had a substantially higher rate of defeats than the others. Additionally, we observed that teams playing with more midfielders do not obtain higher percentages of ball possession, that teams lining up more players in defense do not receive less goals and, finally, that teams playing with more forwards tend to score more goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, this study was not meant to understand the cause between the different correlations (e.g. home teams winning more matches than away teams), but to find out whether these correlations are backed by evidence or not. Also, it is worth noting that without carrying out a proper statistical testing, it is not possible to make predictions for the future and, therefore, the results concluded here are only representative of the data included in the database."
